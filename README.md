# **Project Overview: Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning**

This project focuses on creating a predictive tool for assessing stroke risk using advanced machine learning techniques. It leverages a **Flask-based backend** to manage data processing and machine learning operations, while a **Flutter-based frontend** provides a seamless, cross-platform interface for healthcare professionals. Stroke is a major health concern, being one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability. The aim of this project is to develop a practical, accessible, and accurate prediction model that can assist in early diagnosis, helping to prevent severe outcomes through timely medical intervention.

## **Technical Stack**
- **Backend**: Built using **Flask**, the backend serves as the core of the project. It handles API requests, processes patient data, and integrates with the machine learning models to provide predictions in real-time. The backend is designed to be efficient and scalable, capable of managing large datasets and multiple requests simultaneously.**Firebase** for user authentication and data storage
- **Frontend**: Developed with **Flutter**, the frontend is designed to be a user-friendly, intuitive interface that works across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web). It allows healthcare providers to input patient data, view prediction results, and explore risk factors in a clear and accessible format.
- **Machine Learning**: Used Random forest algorithm with feature analysis and smote smoothning to predict the chances of stroke

## **Objectives**
1. **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Utilize a comprehensive dataset that includes crucial indicators like age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, BMI, smoking status, and other demographic information. This phase involves cleaning and preprocessing data by handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing numerical data for optimal machine learning performance.
2. **Model Development**: The backend is equipped to handle various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and ensemble models like XGBoost. These algorithms will be tested and refined to find the most accurate and efficient prediction model.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Focus on extracting relevant features and engineering new variables to improve the prediction model. This includes identifying interactions between factors (e.g., age combined with BMI) that may influence stroke risk.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Models are rigorously evaluated using a range of metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC—to ensure high predictive power. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize the model and minimize overfitting.
5. **Model Interpretability**: To make the model's predictions understandable and actionable for healthcare professionals, interpretability techniques like SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) are applied. This allows users to see how each factor contributes to an individual's stroke risk.
6. **Deployment and Scalability**: The final model is deployed through a Flask API, allowing it to serve predictions securely and efficiently. The app is designed to be scalable, capable of handling increased data loads as more patient data becomes available, making it suitable for large-scale healthcare settings.

## **Key Features**
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The Flutter frontend provides a clean and easy-to-navigate interface where healthcare professionals can input patient data. It delivers immediate, easy-to-understand feedback on stroke risk, displayed through intuitive visuals and statistics.
2. **Real-Time Predictions**: With the Flask backend, predictions are delivered in real-time, allowing quick decision-making in clinical environments. The system supports batch processing as well, enabling the analysis of multiple cases simultaneously.
3. **Data Visualization**: The frontend includes graphical displays, such as risk factor breakdowns and comparison charts, to help clinicians better understand and communicate risk levels to patients.
4. **Secure Data Handling**: Sensitive patient data is managed securely through encrypted data storage and compliance with healthcare data privacy standards. The system supports multi-factor authentication and role-based access to ensure that only authorized users can access the application.
5. **API Integration**: The backend API can be integrated with existing healthcare systems, allowing for seamless data exchange and potential incorporation into electronic health records (EHR) systems.
